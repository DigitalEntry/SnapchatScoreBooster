# SnapchatScoreBooster

## Prerequisites
An android device with USB debugging enabled, This will **NOT** work on apple devices
You will need snapchat version 11.22.0.33 or below
Make sure you have friends added that don't mind getting spammed with snaps, I suggest adding 180-250 celebrities and sending the snap to them

## Setup
Plug in your device with USB debugging enabled

Pick how the program will click on your screen, **NOTE** I have not tested the option to test coordinates generated by the program so use at your own risk, To get custom coordinates go to Settings > Developer Options > Pointer Location and turn it on, Record the X and Y values and put it into the program

Send a single snap to all the people you want to send the snap too, This is to make sure that they will show up on your recent snap list, if you are in alot of groupchats this method may not work because the Last Snap button needs to be visible when it presses the send button

Tell the application how many rounds of snaps you want to send, 1 round is 8 snaps sent to each person/celeb on your list
